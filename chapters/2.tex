There is a boundary to rationality. What lies beyond there? it is wittgenstein’s whatever one cannot speak of one must remain silent. It is Jonah and the whale. It is 塞翁失馬 塞翁得馬。 it is isaiah chapter 55 verse 8 - my ways are not your ways. It is reflexivity. It is karma. It is serendipity. It is revelation. It is the integral factor rule. A computational competent man would compute his rational conclusions without fault. A wise man would know where his rationality ends and let God work his powers.
