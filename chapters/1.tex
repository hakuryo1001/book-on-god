Is there a single proof of the non existence of God that is constructive, and not of the proof by contradiction or rebuttal variety? 

But arguably, you can’t actually do that. You can’t. You can never arrive at a proposition of an impossibility through construction. How could you construct the nonexistence or something?  

The assertion that something is impossible can only be arrived through contradiction proof by contradiction and improved by contradiction relies on commitment to certain an axiom which allows you to say if I commit to these axioms then such and such as impossible   

有冇可能搵到一個「實做」嘅證明，證明神根本唔存在？唔係靠反證法，唔係靠逐個駁返去嗰種。

但講真，其實做唔到嘅。真係做唔到。你永遠唔可以用建構方法去攞到一個「唔可能存在」嘅命題。點樣實際去建構「無嘢存在」呢？

你要講一樣嘢係唔可能，最後都只可以靠反證。反證本身就係要靠住一啲公理：即係話，如果我接受呢啲公理，咁咁樣就一定唔可能。
